## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I really am gettig more comfortable with nesting in html and how much that effects the css relationship. I also use display: grid on the container to place the content directly in the middle of the page, instead of playing with margin or padding. I thought that was cool.

```CSS
body {
    background-color: var(--project-background);
    display: grid; 
    place-items: center; 
    height: 100%;
}
```

### Continued development

I always want to continue improving on the box model and getting more comfortable with height and weight in relation to their parent container.
